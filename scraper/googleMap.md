Best And Free Google Map Scraper:
1. scrape all XXX in a region, such as all restaurants in Los Angeles
2. scrape place by list of urls, such as "https://www.google.com/maps/search/Cafe+in+los+angeles/@34.0529113,-118.2571186,13z?hl=en&entry=ttu"

There are many free and paid google map scrapers, if you find one that is better (like less network traffic or proxy fees, less memory or CPU), please let me know, buy a free coffee or design a new web scraper.

Anyone can use it for free, scraping the data by yourself. I also can provide paid services.

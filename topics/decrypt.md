# How to Decrypt Encrypted Information
Data extracted from some web pages is unreadable, but the content displayed on the page is readable, such as content displayed using custom TTF or SVG fonts. In other words, the data to be extracted is encrypted.

Since this information is readable to web page users, a screenshot can be taken first and then recognized by [OCR](/topics/ocr). The disadvantage is that it is costly.

LetsScrapeData supports decryption of TTF and SVG fonts at no additional cost; see ***fonts***.

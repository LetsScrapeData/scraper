# How to Recognize Text in Images
LSD utilizes third-party OCR services to recognize text in images (including screenshots). See ***ocrcfg_api***.

The OCR API is charged per use. To reduce costs, LetsScrapeData supports merging multiple images together for recognition.

It is strongly discouraged to use OCR to recognize text in image Captchas, as the success rate is extremely low. For instructions on how to resolve these CAPTCHAs, see [How to Resolve Captchas](/topics/captcha).
